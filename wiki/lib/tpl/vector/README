PLEASE NOTE: I am NO native English speaker. If you find any errors please let
             me know (e.g. by mail). Otherwise, my English is not getting better
             (as desired by myself). Thank you! -- Andreas Haerter



I. Using/Installing the template
  Using "vector" is simple and works just as described at
  <http://www.dokuwiki.org/template>: extract the downloaded archive into
  your DokuWiki's "lib/tpl/" folder. Then select the template in the Config
  Manager by adjusting the template option. Done. :-)

  If you are updating an existing vector-installation: please have a look at
  <http://www.dokuwiki.org/template:vector>, you should find all needed
  information there.

  NOTE: If everything will be displayed unformatted, your PHP environment is
        probably affected by PHP bug #49692 (see bugreport at
        <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=49692> for details). You may find errors
        like "syntax error, unexpected '/' in ../../lib/tpl/vector/style.ini
        on line XX" in your PHP logs when this is the case. vector provides
        a workaround for this, simply delete the vector's "style.ini" to trigger
        the template to use it.



II. Customizing the template
  In order to make updates of your installed "vector" template easy, follow
  these hints for customizing the template:

  - Place your files in "vector/user"
    The place for *all* userdefined, custom stuff is "vector/user".
    Reason: this folder will not be touched on updates. Therefore you may delete
    everything except "vector/user" and copy all new files into "vector/" to
    update without loosing your changes. Do not forget to empty your browser's
    cache afterwards.

  - Own logo
    If you want to replace the default logo showed in the upper left, simply
    create a "logo.[png|gif|jpg]" in "vector/user". The template recognizes
    the file automatically and will use it instead of the default logo.
    Do not forget to empty your browser's cache afterwards.

  - Own favicon
    If you want to replace the default favicon, simply create a "favicon.ico" in
    "vector/user". The template recognizes the file automatically and will use
    it instead of the default one. Do not forget to empty your browser's cache
    afterwards. By the way: you might find the following online tool useful:
    <http://tools.dynamicdrive.com/favicon/>
    Note: "favicon.png" is also possible but not recommended (cause it is not
          supported by most MSIE versions).

  - Own CSS
    To apply additional CSS rules, edit "vector/user/screen.css" (influences
    normal layout) and/or "vector/user/print.css" (influences print layout)
    and/or "vector/user/rtl.css" (influences "right-to-left" languages like
    hebrew). These files will be included automatically (as the last ones for
    the relevant media, therefore you are able to overrule existing styles). Do
    not forget to empty your browser's cache afterwards.

  - Own JavaScript
    To load additional JavaScript, edit "vector/user/user.js". Do not forget
    to empty your browser's cache afterwards.
    ATTENTION: Do not forget to activate the template option
               "vector_loaduserjs" (->"Load 'vector/user/user.js'?") in the
               DokuWiki Config Manager!

  - Own CSS, language specific
    To apply additional CSS rules only for a specific language, edit/create
    "vector/lang/<your-language>/style.css". This file will be included
    automatically if DokuWiki runs/shows a page in the language of choice (as
    the last one, therefore you are able to overrule existing styles). Do
    not forget to empty your browser's cache afterwards.

  - Own tabs
    To apply own tabs, have a look at "vector/user/tabs.php". Don't worry:
    you will find some examples how to define the tabs. If you still have
    questions after playing with the examples, search
    <http://dokuwiki.org/template:vector> and/or the DokuWiki Forum at
    <http://forum.dokuwiki.org> and/or ask the community if you can't get it
    work.
    If "vector/user/tabs.php" does not exist, simply copy it out of the
    current actual installation archive.

  - Own footer buttons
    To apply own buttons/graphics in the footer (-> these small 80x15 pics),
    have a look at "vector/user/buttons.php". Don't worry: you will find some
    examples how to define the buttons. If you still have questions after
    playing with the examples, search <http://dokuwiki.org/template:vector>
    and/or the DokuWiki Forum at <http://forum.dokuwiki.org> and/or ask the
    community if you can't get it work.
    If "vector/user/buttons.php" does not exist, simply copy it out of the
    current actual installation archive.

  - Own boxes
    To apply own boxes in the left column/sidebar, have a look at
    "vector/user/boxes.php". Don't worry: you will find some examples how to
    define the boxes. If you still have questions after
    playing with the examples, search <http://dokuwiki.org/template:vector>
    and/or the DokuWiki Forum at <http://forum.dokuwiki.org> and/or ask the
    community if you can't get it work.
    If "vector/user/boxes.php" does not exist, simply copy it out of the
    current actual installation archive.

  - Web analytics software (Piwik, Google Analytics etc.)
    Tools like Piwik and Google Analytics normally provide a small code snippet
    ("tag") which you have to include at your website to make everything work.
    If you want to use such software with this template, have a look at
    "vector/user/tracker.php". This file exists to make it easier for you. You
    You don't have to deliberate where you have to copy and paste the code,
    simply do it there.



III. Some notes about the dirs of this template

  * "vector/conf"
    Configuration files. See
    <http://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:templates#directory_layout> for information.
  * "vector/lang"
    Language. See <http://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:templates#directory_layout> for
    information. You may copy the English language files and translate them
    if your language is missing (hint: looking at
    <http://[your lang].wikipedia.org> might be helpful). Simply mail me,
    Andreas Haerter, the translated files, I will include them in the next
    release :-D.
  * "vector/static"
    Static files (images, CSS, JavaScript). The interesting stuff is located
    in subdirs (as described below).
  * "vector/static/3rd"
    Static files originally taken from a third party.
  * "vector/static/3rd/dokuwiki"
    Static files originally taken from the DokuWiki "default" or "starter"
    template.

    simply copy a logo.[png|gif|jpg] in here. See "II. Customizing the template"
    for details.



IV. Other notes
  - Even if it is not required: If you like the template, think about a small
    donation (see <http://andreas-haerter.com/donate/vector>) and/or a link to
    <http://andreas-haerter.com/projects/dokuwiki-template-vector>.
    Thanks :-).

  - This template follows the DokuWiki coding style (see
    <http://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:coding_style>). If you want to submit any
    patches, please respect its rules (even if you don't like it - I also don't
    love it but this simply does not matter).

  - Feel free to send patches or suggestions via mail (or post on
    <http://www.dokuwiki.org/template:vector>).

  - Please don't delete the "index.html" and ".htaccess" files for security
    reasons, even if you don't know why they are there. These files should
    prevent others from listing directory contents (a built in feature of most
    webservers) and providing additional access protection for some files. Even
    if everything should be secure without, I prefer some additional
    precautions.



V. About
  "vector" is a template to offer the new MediaWiki/Wikipedia Look&Feel
  (introduced in 2010) to DokuWiki. It is a (mostly) optical port of the
  MediaWiki skin and maintained/developed by me, Andreas Haerter.
  If you have any suggestions and/or bug reports, feel free to post on
  <http://www.dokuwiki.org/template:vector>, send me an email or have a look at
  <http://andreas-haerter.com/contact>.



VI. Creation transcript
  Some developers may find this interesting. Additionally, I am very oblivious
  :-P.

  - Downloaded the nightly MediaWiki build (cause only the SVN version is
    containing the vector skin as I'm writing this) from
    <http://toolserver.org/~vvv/mw-nightly/>.

  - Installed DokuWiki (Release "2009-12-25c", "Lemming") for testing purpose.

  - Copied all "monobook for DokuWiki" sources cause it already fits some of
    my needs regarding config options and non-layout features. Means: I used the
    source of the "monobook for DokuWiki" template as base for
    "vector for DokuWiki".

  - replaced "monobook" through "vector" in:
    - /conf/*
    - /lang/*
    - /bug49642.php
    - /detail.php
    - /inc_cite.php
    - /inc_detail.php
    - /inc_mediamanager.php
    - /main.php
    - /mediamanager.php

  - After investigation, some 3rd-party files were copied into the provided
    places within "/vector/static/3rd".
    - The following files were copied from the original vector skin:
      - /skins/vector/csshover.htc
      - /skins/vector/main-ltr.css
      - /skins/vector/main-rtl.css
      - /skins/vector/images/*
    - The following files were copied from Andreas Gohr's "default" DokuWiki
      template:
      * /default/*.css (see <http://j.mp/eq8zSo> why I do this)
      * /default/images/closed.gif
      * /default/images/favicon.ico
      * /default/images/link_icon.gif
      * /default/images/mail_icon.gif
      * /default/images/open.gif
      * /default/images/tocdot2.gif
      * /default/images/windows.gif

  - Edited:
    - "/vector/static/3rd/vector/main-ltr.css"
      "/vector/static/3rd/vector/main-rtl.css"
      All url() rules were edited (-> replaced "url(images/" through
      "url(static/3rd/vector/", deleted "?1" and "?2 postfixes").
      To make this clear, a comment was added at the top of the files:
      /* ATTENTION: This file was edited for the "vector template for DokuWiki".
                    - All url() rules where changed.
                     See README for details. */

    - "/vector/static/3rd/dokuwiki/design.css"
      All url() rules were edited (-> replaced "url(images/" through
      "url(static/3rd/dokuwiki/").
      To make this clear, a comment was added at the top of the files:
      /* ATTENTION: This file was edited for the "vector template for DokuWiki".
                    - All url() rules where changed.
                     See README for details. */

  - Visited <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ASCII>, copied the XHTML
    source and let Tidy do the dirty work to get a valid clean and correctly
    indented base markup (after core removal, for sure). This markup was then
    compared with the current main.php and needed changes where done.

  - Created new files:
    * "vector/static/css/print.css"
    * "vector/static/css/rtl.css"
    * "vector/static/css/screen.css"
    All relevant information should be found within the inline comments.

  - Worked worked worked a few days.... and done! :-P

  - After ~1 year, I switched the CSS base from DokuWiki's default template
    to <http://www.dokuwiki.org/template:starter>. See
    <http://www.freelists.org/post/dokuwiki/Core-devs-I-need-some-info-to-keep-my-templates-maintainable>
    for more information about this. I edited
    "vector/static/3rd/dokuwiki/_links.css|_toc.css": url() rules were edited
    (-> "static/3rd/..."). To make this clear, a comment was added at the top of
    the files. "static/3rd/dokuwiki/bullet|close|open.gif" were re-saved as PNG.
